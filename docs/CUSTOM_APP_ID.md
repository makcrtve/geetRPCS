## Steps

1.  **Open Discord Developer Portal**
    Go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in with your Discord account.

2.  **Create a New Application**
    *   Click on the **"New Application"** button (top right).
    *   Give it a name (e.g., "geetRPCS Custom"). This name will represent your "Game" name in Discord status.
    *   Agree to the terms and click **Create**.

3.  **Get the Application ID**
    *   You will be redirected to the **General Information** page.
    *   Look for **"Application ID"**.

4.  **Upload Assets (Optional - for images)**
    *   Go to the **"Rich Presence"** -> **"Art Assets"** tab in the left menu.
    *   Click **"Add Images"** and upload your images (e.g., logo, cover).
    *   **Important:** Remember the name (Key) of the image you uploaded. You will need to type this *exactly* in the config.

5.  **Use it in geetRPCS**
    *   Open **geetRPCS**.
    *   Right-click the tray icon -> **Manage Apps** -> **Change Application ID...**

You're all set! Your custom presence should now be active.
